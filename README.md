Recursive-File-Replacer
=======================

Recursive File Replacer does a recursive scan of the selected folder, replacing any file where the filename matches the case insensitive search term with the user-specified replacement file. A check is made to ensure that the file to replace with never tries to overwrite itself.  Created by Craig Lotter, December 2005
